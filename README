  I could not build the project using the given build xml file.
  I spent quite some time, trying to fix the build.xml, but i could not.
  So, I am just zipping the file and submitting it. 
  After unzipping the submit-hw3.zip,
  
  1.1
  How to setup the NodeFactory:
  
  Copy the "target" directory and deploy into eniac.
  cd target
  java -cp "WEB-INF/lib/*:WEB-INF/classes/" edu.upenn.cis455.youtube.P2PCache <localport> <bootstrapip>
  <bootport> <daemon port> <database directory>
  
  This should start the node factory
  
  1.2
  How to Run Servlet(I used jetty, if testing in tomcat, please note that the WEB-INF folder
  is in HW3/WEB-INF)
  
  Incase of Jetty,
  
  Copy HW3/WEB-INF(with web.xml parameters set appropriately) into Jetty folder in the appropriate
  context.(for example, say my context path is "Youtube", then create a folder "Youtube" inside
  
  Log into a spec machine.
  cd <jettyfolder>
  java -jar start.jar     [this will start the server in default port 8080]
  
  Now open the browser and type 
  spec<no>.seas.upenn.edu:8080/Youtube/youtube
  
  This should open the servlet.
  
  I am apologize for the detailed instruction. If you need a demo, i can come down for that.
